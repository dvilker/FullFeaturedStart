#from:en.txt#FullFeaturedStart
FullFeaturedStart=The mod generously gives:\n- how many construction drones do you need.\n- a vest with the right equipment grid size.\n- a stack of all possible items of equipment.\n- allows you to slightly speed up the drones.\n- some rocket fuel to last to the oil refineries (if you happen to have a JetPack). In SE, I recommend not adding fuel - there is already something to fly there.\n- allows you to reduce the size of the items of equipment by a factor to fit more.\n\nIn general, everything for a comfortable start!
