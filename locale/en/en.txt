##### FullFeaturedStart

The mod generously gives:
- how many construction drones do you need.
- a vest with the right equipment grid size.
- a stack of all possible items of equipment.
- allows you to slightly speed up the drones.
- some rocket fuel to last to the oil refineries (if you happen to have a JetPack). In SE, I recommend not adding fuel - there is already something to fly there.
- allows you to reduce the size of the items of equipment by a factor to fit more.

In general, everything for a comfortable start!
